In order to get Beacon fully working, however, you need to
set up the database manually.
For this, follow the steps as described below.

1. Make sure the mysqld service is running.
If you are root or have sudo, this can be done by
# service mysqld start

2. Type mysql on the command line.
This should take you to the mysql interpreter.

3. Type the following commands to setup a database, create a
user and give him permissions to access the database.

CREATE DATABASE <database-name>;
CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database-name>.* TO '<username>'@'localhost';

The database name, user name and password are set as 'beacon'
by default in beacon/php/settings.php. Your real settings should
be reflected in that file too.
